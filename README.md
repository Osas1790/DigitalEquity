# Digital Equity Learning

Hello World from **UMSI MADS Capstone Project Team 26: Digital Equity Learning**

Our project is a social good project related to finding key insights in digital data and the relationship between network Quality of Experience (QoE) and Digital Equity.
We are looking to connect and collaborate with researchers in the community who would have background knowledge of datasets from intiatives such as:

- Digital Inclusion project at MIDAS: https://midas.umich.edu/ds-for-public-good/
- Internet Equity Initiative at the University of Chicago: https://internetequity.org/
- Hardware-Based Broadband Testing Iniative at Merit Network Research: https://www.merit.edu/networkresearch
- Broadband and Digital Inclusion initiatives at the Quello Center: https://quello.msu.edu/broadbanddigitalinclusion/

 
Any connections you can help us make are greatly appreciated!
